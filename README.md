# :rocket: Project Guide :rocket:

This circuit synthesis experiment designs three main task requirements, mainly including the study of non-linear distortion of amplifiers, precision DC regulated power supplies, and flame detection circuits. It involves using tools such as STM32CubeMX, Keil, Autium Designer, and Multisim for circuit design, circuit simulation design, single - chip microcomputer peripheral configuration, code logic design, and circuit board design, among many other task practices. The purpose of this experimental project is to deepen the understanding of circuit principles and single - chip microcomputer applications and improve practical operation ability through practical operations. At the same time, the specific experimental design reports will be continuously updated in the [source](source) folder each time, and the corresponding code files are stored in the [src](src) folder. Next, I will introduce in detail the design steps, circuit wiring, code design and other detailed information of each project for your reference.  

## :mag: 1.Non-linear Distortion of Amplifiers

In the first experiment, we used an amplifier circuit composed of a common-emitter amplifier circuit and a class-B amplifier circuit. The specific schematic diagram can be viewed through [Schematic Diagram](assets/Amplifier.pdf). In the amplifier circuit, the CD503 chip needs to control the on-off of the RP4 - RP7 resistors through a single-chip microcomputer to achieve the output of waveforms with no distortion, top distortion, bottom distortion, and two-way distortion. At the same time, it is required to control the touchable serial port screen to achieve the synchronous output of the single-chip microcomputer-controlled D/A and the amplifier waveform, and display it on the oscilloscope.
